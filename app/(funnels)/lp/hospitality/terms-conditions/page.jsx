              4. Client Obligations & Data Desk
            </h2>
            <p>
              To execute precision marketing campaigns and audits, clients must provide timely access to relevant platforms (such as Google Analytics, Booking Engines, and OTA extranet dashboards). All information provided must be accurate, up to date, and not infringe on third-party rights. We reserve the right to pause campaigns or strategy execution if necessary assets are withheld.

            </h2>
            <p>
              While Clever Crow Strategies LLP architects full-funnel marketing campaigns designed to significantly increase direct booking yields and reduce OTA dependency (with past campaigns averaging a 40% growth), digital performance is influenced by external variables. We do not guarantee specific conversion rates, occupancy metrics, or revenue targets as they are subject to market conditions, seasonal fluctuations, and client operational compliance.

              In no event shall Clever Crow Strategies LLP, its directors, or its global team be liable for any indirect, incidental, special, or consequential damages (including, without limitation, loss of business data, booking revenue, or digital platform downtime) arising out of the use or inability to use our website or marketing services, even if notified of the possibility of such damages.
